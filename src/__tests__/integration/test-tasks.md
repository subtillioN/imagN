## Recommendations for Additional Coverage

1. **Integration with React Profiler**
   - Test integration with React Profiler API
   - Verify performance metrics collection
   - Test commit timing analysis

2. **Network Performance**
   - Test behavior with slow network conditions
   - Verify data synchronization delays
   - Test offline functionality

3. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
   - Test in different browser environments
   - Verify WebWorker support
   - Test touch events on mobile

4. **State Persistence**
   - Test localStorage integration
   - Verify state recovery after page reload
   - Test migration of stored data

5. **Error Boundary Testing**
   - Test component error recovery
   - Verify error reporting
   - Test fallback UI

## Implementation Notes
- All core test suites are now implemented
- Consider adding browser-specific test environments
- Add performance regression tests
- Consider adding visual regression tests
