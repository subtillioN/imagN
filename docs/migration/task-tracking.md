    "Not Started" : 60
```

### Phase Progress
- Phase 0: 0/7 tasks completed
- Phase 1: 0/15 tasks completed
- Phase 2: 0/15 tasks completed
- Phase 3: 0/15 tasks completed
- Phase 4: 0/15 tasks completed
- Phase 5: 0/15 tasks completed

    C --> D[Phase 3: Feature Migration]
    D --> E[Phase 4: Integration]
    E --> F[Phase 5: Release]
```

## Priority Levels
- P0: Blocker - Must be completed before any other work
- P1: Critical - Required for basic functionality
- P2: Important - Required for full feature set
- P3: Nice to have - Can be completed after release

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 0 tasks
2. Set up repository and basic infrastructure
3. Create initial documentation
4. Configure build system
5. Begin core feature migration

## Notes
- All tasks should include tests
- Documentation should be updated as features are implemented
- Each phase should include performance testing
- Security considerations should be addressed in each phase
