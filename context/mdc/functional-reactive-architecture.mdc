# Functional Reactive Architecture

The imagN application follows a Functional Reactive Architecture with Aspect-Oriented Primitives (FRAOP). This architecture ensures immutability, predictability, and modularity.

## Key Principles
- **Pure Functional Programming**: Ensures immutability and predictability.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming**: Enhances modularity and maintainability.
- **Advanced Operators and Functionality**: Manages data streams and state effectively.
