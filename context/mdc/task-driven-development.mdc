# Task-Driven Development

The imagN application development process is driven by tasks, ensuring that each feature is developed with a clear purpose.

## Key Practices
- **Task Definition**: Clearly define tasks before development.
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members.
- **Task Tracking**: Track progress of tasks using a task management tool.
