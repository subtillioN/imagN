# Aspect-Oriented Primitives

The imagN application integrates aspect-oriented programming primitives to enhance modularity and maintainability without using object-oriented patterns.

## Key Concepts
- **Aspects**: Modular units of cross-cutting concerns.
- **Join Points**: Points in the program where aspects can be applied.
- **Advice**: Code that is executed at a join point.
