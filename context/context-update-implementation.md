# Context Update Command Implementation

## Overview

The `/context-update` command has been fully implemented to process new issues from the testing department log, update appropriate task lists and documentation, and refresh vector embeddings for the context system.

## Components Created

1. **Script File**: `.cursor/scripts/context-updater.js`
   - Reads issues from `context/new-issues-log.md`
   - Categorizes issues as bugs or enhancements
   - Adds bugs to `buglog.md`
   - Adds enhancements to `progress-tracking.md`
   - Marks processed issues as completed in the issues log
   - Updates vector embeddings for all changed files

2. **NPM Script**: Added to `package.json`
   ```json
   "context:update": "node .cursor/scripts/context-updater.js"
   ```

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added command to `.cursor/rules/context-management.md`
   - Added command to `context/context-management.md`
   - Updated `context/README.md` to include the new command
   - Added implementation to `context/progress-tracking.md` as a completed task

## How It Works

1. **Issue Parsing**: The script parses the `new-issues-log.md` file to identify new issues (lines starting with `+`).

2. **Issue Categorization**: Issues are categorized based on keywords in their descriptions:
   - UI/UX issues: Contains terms like 'ui', 'button', 'display', 'padding', etc.
   - Performance issues: Contains terms like 'slow', 'performance', 'lag', etc.
   - Feature requests: Contains terms like 'add', 'feature', 'enhance', etc.

3. **Component Determination**: The script determines which component the issue belongs to:
   - Workflow Presets: Contains 'preset' or 'workflow'
   - Project Management: Contains 'project' or 'dialog'
   - Image Workspace: Contains 'image'
   - Video Workspace: Contains 'video'
   - Node Editor: Contains 'node'
   - General: Default category

4. **Bug Log Updates**: Bugs are added to the Active Bugs section in `buglog.md` with a new ID.

5. **Progress Tracking Updates**: Enhancements are added as tasks to the appropriate section in `progress-tracking.md`.

6. **Issue Log Updates**: Processed issues are marked as completed in `new-issues-log.md`.

7. **Vector Embedding Updates**: Vector embeddings are updated for all changed files.

## Usage

To process new issues, run:

```bash
npm run context:update
```

Or in the Cursor AI chat window:

```
/context-update
```

## Testing Results

The command has been tested and successfully:
- Processed the issue "need padding above the 'Project Name' input field"
- Added it as bug B015 to the buglog.md file
- Marked it as completed in the new-issues-log.md file
- Updated vector embeddings for relevant files

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Add support for issue priorities in the new-issues-log.md format
- Implement automatic assignment of issues to team members
- Add support for linking issues to specific files or code locations
- Create a web interface for viewing and managing issues
