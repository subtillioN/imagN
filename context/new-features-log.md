# New Features Log
This is a log for new features which need to be put into the appropriate task-list or a new one. If a new task has been made for the feature it can be marked as complete and marked with a - [x] checkbox.

- add new feature to switch unicode mappings for the UI, with another icon next to styles and dev-tools. One option will be leetspeek. But this will serve a much greater function later. For this we will need to isolate the strings and run them through a filter to update their unicode mapping. Sort of like localization. We could add other options that you think of, other standard languages perhaps.
- Implement dev-tools button and dev-tools window.
- Add new tab button called glipN to the left of Image Workspace, and open a new glipN window on click.
- Capability to fork every presetwith chaos levels and randomization.
- Capability to randomly mix presets to come up with novel node configurations.
- In node editor, the capability to select from a list of effects for video or audo as nodes to drag into the node editor workspace and hook together intuitively and interactively.
- [x] a rule in .cursor/rules that automatically loads the default context.
