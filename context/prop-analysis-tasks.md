# Prop Analysis Enhancement Tasks

## Week 1: Performance Optimizations and Test Coverage

### Performance Optimizations (Critical)
- [x] Implement memoization for prop analysis calculations
  ```typescript
  // PropAnalyzer.ts
  private memoizedAnalysis: PropAnalysisResult | null = null;
  private lastAnalysisTimestamp: number = 0;
  ```
- [x] Add batch processing for multiple prop updates
- [x] Optimize memory usage for long-running sessions
- [x] Add performance benchmarking utilities

### Test Coverage Enhancements (High)
- [x] Add tests for deep nested object prop changes
  ```typescript
  it('should track deep object prop changes', () => {
    const deepObj1 = { nested: { value: 1 } };
    const deepObj2 = { nested: { value: 2 } };
  });
  ```
- [x] Add tests for array prop mutations
- [x] Add tests for prop value history tracking
- [x] Add performance regression tests

## Week 2: Visualization Improvements

### Visualization Improvements (High)
- [x] Add time-series visualization for prop changes (PropTimeline component)
- [x] Add prop value history timeline (PropValueHistory component)
- [x] Add component relationship diagram (ComponentRelationship component)
- [x] Add performance impact visualization (PerformanceImpact component)

## Week 3: Developer Experience and New Features

### Developer Experience (Medium)
- [ ] Add inline documentation in DevTools
- [ ] Implement one-click optimization suggestions
- [ ] Add export functionality for analysis reports
- [x] Add real-time monitoring dashboard (MonitoringDashboard component)

### New Features (Medium)
- [x] Add prop value prediction based on patterns
  ```typescript
  interface PropPrediction {
    componentName: string;
    propName: string;
    predictedValue: any;
    confidence: number;
  }
  ```
- [x] Implement automatic memoization suggestions
- [x] Add component re-render impact analysis
  ```typescript
  interface RenderImpact {
    componentName: string;
    renderCount: number;
    cascadingEffects: number;
    criticalProps: string[];
  }
  ```
- [x] Add smart optimization recommendations
  ```typescript
  interface Recommendation {
    componentName: string;
    type: 'memoization' | 'propStructure' | 'renderOptimization' | 'stateManagement';
    priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    impact: number;
    description: string;
    suggestedCode?: string;
  }
  ```

## Week 4: Integration and Documentation

### Documentation Updates (Low)
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Include performance impact case studies
  ```markdown
  ## Case Study: High-Frequency Props
  Before: 150ms render time
  After: 45ms render time
  ```
- [ ] Add troubleshooting decision tree
- [ ] Create video tutorials

### Final Polish
- [ ] Performance optimization pass
- [ ] UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] Final documentation review

    component: componentName,
    props,
    analysis: propAnalyzer.getComponentPropUsage(componentName)
  });

### Documentation Updates
- 0/4 tasks completed
- Planned for Week 4

### Final Polish
- 0/4 tasks completed
- Planned for Week 4

## Next Steps
- Begin work on integration improvements
- Plan documentation updates
- Prepare for final polish phase

## Notes
- Priority is indicated by order (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Each task should include tests and documentation
- Regular progress updates will be tracked here
- Dependencies between tasks are noted in task descriptions

## Getting Started
1. ✅ Begin with performance optimizations
2. ✅ Run existing test suite
3. ✅ Implement new tests
4. ✅ Add performance benchmarking utilities
5. ✅ Add time-series visualization
6. Next: Implement prop value history timeline

## Review Process
- Code review required for all changes
- Performance benchmarks must be run before/after changes
- Documentation must be updated with each feature
- UI changes require design review
