I have created the context/new-features-log.md to request new features. This should mimic the functionality for the new-issues-log.md context. New tasks for the feature task-set should be created and the context docs thoroughly updated.


I've added the context/new-issues-log.md file to the context/ folder which is a log for the testing department to log new issues which need to be put into the appropriate task-list or a new one on /context-update command. If a new task has been made for the issue it can be marked as complete and marked with a - [ ] checkbox.

And let's add all the files in context/ that will help you boot quickly into a deep understanding of the entire code-base, such as a context summary and an outline. Also perhaps a vector file of your current that can be saved and loaded on boot. Set up a command structure in the .cursor/rules/ system so that you can load and save these files, and save and restore your context by name.

Let's research into integrating react-scan into this project. @https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan Don't change any code or begin on this but do a detailed analys of the pros and cons and the migration strategy for this feature, and add another deep analysis and migration plan complete with diagrams where needed.
